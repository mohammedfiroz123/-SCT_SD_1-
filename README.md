Temperature Converter App: A simple GUI-based temperature converter built with Python's Tkinter library for backend logic, and HTML and JavaScript for the frontend interface. It allows users to easily convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with a user-friendly interface.

HTML: Defines the structure of the page, such as headings, labels, input fields, and buttons.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for temperature conversion, including the functions that perform the calculations and update the page with results.
CSS: Although not explicitly in this code, there is a basic style applied through HTML elements (e.g., <div class="container">), and CSS could be applied to style the appearance.
